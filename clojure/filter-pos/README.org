* Problem

  For a given list with *N* integers, return a new list removing the
  elements at odd positions. The input and output portions will be
  handled automatically. You need to write a function with the
  recommended method signature.

  *Input Format*

  *N* integers contained in the list, each on a separate line.

  *Output Format*

  Output the list with the integers at odd positions removed i.e. the
  first element, the third element and so on. The relative positions of
  the remaining even-position elements should be the same as they were
  in the original array. Each integer will be on a separate line.
