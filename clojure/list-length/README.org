* Problem

  Count the number of elements in an array without using count, size or
  length operators (or their equivalents). The input and output portions
  will be handled automatically by the grader. You only need to write a
  function with the recommended method signature.

  *Input Format*

  A list of *N* integers, each on a separate line.

  *Output Format*

  Output a single integer *N*, the length of the list that was provided as input.

* Constrains

  1. 0 <= N <= 10
  2. Each element, *X*, in the list:  0 <= X <= 100

* Samples
** Input

   #+BEGIN_SRC

   9
   #+END_SRC

** Output

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   10
   #+END_SRC

* Recommended Method Signature

  - Number Of Parameters: 1
  - Parameters: [list]
