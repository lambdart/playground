* Overview

  This repository it's just a place to save
  solved exercises from diverse sources - everything
  is organized by directory and the exercise instruction,
  origin and difficulty will be displayed at its README.

  You can checkout the list of solved exercises in the *Solved*
  section and quickly jump to the solution (source code).

  My focus right now is functional programming languages with the
  following order of priority:

  1. Clojure
  2. ClojureScript
  3. Elixir/Erlang
  4. Common Lisp
  5. OCaml
  6. Scheme

* Solved

  Here is the list of solved problems so far:

  | Difficulty | Title            | Language | Solution       |

  To see a world in a grain of sand
  And a heaven in a wild flower,
  Hold infinity in the palm of your hand,
  And eternity in an hour.
